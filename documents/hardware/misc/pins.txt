The inputs are opto-isolated; they are active low at the controller, and this
state is activated by pulling the input pin to ground. This applies to switches;
the proximity sensors are active high at the controller.

The opto inputs also require the +12v supply on the bob, don't work otherwise

in the new config, the motion relay is moved from p1.17 to p1.2; it is now
also active low instead of active high

make sure that y and a turn in opposite directions, wiring or configuration!

on the ucccnc eth300 board, p1 and p4 are bidirectional; p2, p3, and p5 are
preconfigured for inputs

testing p4.5 is step p4.4 is dir

the switch documentation on the kl-5056 seems to be backwards, where up/down are
not correctly represented. "down""on" appears to be a zero for the purposes
of interpreting the diagram
