# Hunayang RS485 commands

Hunayang inverters claim to be Modbus compatible - they are not :-(
So here i try to create a nice list of all commands and their meaning.

**I assume the use of the RTU mode.**

## Parameter settings

 - PD001: 2 (Source of run commands: communication port)
 - PD002: 2 (Source of operating frequency: communication port)
 - PD163: 1 (Communication address: 1)
 - PD164: 1 (Communication Baud Rate: 9600)
 - PD165: 3 (Communication Data Method: 8N1 RTU)

## Functioncode 01 - Read function code data

`slave address` `function code` `data length` `function data` `crc`

If `function data` is 2 bytes, `data length` is `0x03`, if just 1 byte `0x02`

**Unfortunately the complete manual says nothing about themeaning of `function data`, so i have no idea what this function really does**

## Functioncode 02 - Write function code data

`slave address` `function code` `data length` `function data` `crc`

If `function data` is 2 bytes, `data length` is `0x03`, if just 1 byte `0x02`

**Unfortunately the complete manual says nothing about themeaning of `function data`, so i have no idea what this function really does**

## Functioncode 03 - Write control data

`slave address` `function code` `data length` `control data` `crc`

### Data to the VFD

`0x01` `0x03` `0x01` `0x08` `0xF1` `0x8E`

 - 0x01 = slave address
 - 0x03 = function code
 - 0x01 = request length
 - 0x08 = stop
 - 0xF1 0x8E = CRC16

The manual says possible control data values are:

 - 0 = run
 - 1 = for
 - 2 = rev
 - 3 = stop
 - 4 = r/f
 - 5 = jog
 - 6 = jogf
 - 7 = jogr

Its not entirely clear why 8 stops the VFD but maybe the possible options are bit positions in a byte rather than actual values.

### Response from the VFD

`0x01` `0x03` `0x01` `0x09` `0x30` `0x4E`

 - 0x01 = slave address
 - 0x03 = function code
 - 0x01 = request length
 - 0x09 = ??
 - 0x30 0x4E = CRC16
  
The manual says possible control status responses are:

 - 0 = run
 - 1 = jog
 - 2 = r/f
 - 3 = running
 - 4 = jogging
 - 5 = r/f
 - 6 = Braking
 - 7 = Track start
